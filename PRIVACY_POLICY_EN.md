Money Flow App Privacy Policy
Last Updated: October 21, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the Money Flow mobile application ("App") developed by enesyetisdirdim collects, uses, and protects user data.

By using our App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

1. Information Collection
The primary purpose of our App is to help you manage your financial data. The information we collect allows us to provide this functionality and falls into two main categories:

a) Information You Provide: All core financial data in the App is entered entirely by you and is stored solely locally on your device. This data is not sent to our servers and cannot be accessed by us. This data includes:

Account Information: Names, currencies, and opening balances of accounts you create (e.g., Cash, Bank).

Income and Expense Transactions: Title, amount, date, category, source, and description of all income and expenses you enter.

Savings Goals and Budgets: Savings goals and category-based budgets you create.

Fixed Expenses: Your recurring monthly payments and their details.

Photos: Invoice or product photos you add to expense transactions. These photos are also stored solely on your device.

b) Automatically Collected Information (Third-Party Services): We use the Google AdMob service to display advertisements in the free version of the App. Google AdMob may collect certain data, such as your device's Advertising ID, to provide ads tailored to your interests. For more information on how Google uses data, please review the Google Advertising Privacy Policy.

2. Use of Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

App Functionality: To operate core app functions allowing you to track your financial status, generate reports, and manage your budgets.

Local Notifications: To send you reminder notifications when payment dates for your fixed expenses are approaching.

Ad Display: To display personalized advertisements to cover the development costs of the free version of the App.

Exchange Rate Information: To fetch current and historical exchange rate data from the api.frankfurter.app service to perform accurate calculations in reports and general balances. No personal data is sent during this process.

In-App Purchases: To manage upgrades to the "Money Flow Pro" version, we use Apple App Store and Google Play Billing services. Payment information, such as credit card details, is processed by these providers and is not seen or stored by us.

3. Data Storage and Security
All your financial data is stored in a local SQLite database on your device. Neither we nor any third party has remote access to this data. The security of your data is under your control. When you uninstall the App from your device, all your data is deleted.

When you activate the App Lock feature, your device's biometric (fingerprint, face recognition) or PIN authentication mechanism is used at app startup. Your biometric data is never collected or stored by our App; this process is managed entirely securely by your device's operating system.

4. Permissions
The App may request the following permissions to operate with full functionality:

Notifications: To send fixed expense reminders.

Camera: To add receipts or product photos to expense transactions.

Storage/Files: To export your data in CSV format or save it to your device.

5. Children's Privacy
Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting on this page.
